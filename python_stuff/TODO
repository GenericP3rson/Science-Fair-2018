We have a functional CNN (tfl3.py).
Now we need to make a decision tree (easy).
Also, we need to somehow get training data for the things.
(Maybe we could also make it a Google Assistant for fun...?)

We need to determine what the training data should be.



RUNS:
1) Redness (w/ kernel)
2) Bumps (w/ CNN)
3) Scaly (w/ CNN) ???

TO CHECK:
1) HAM10000

PROCESS:
1) It looks through the body part

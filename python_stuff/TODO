We have a functional CNN (tfl3.py).
Now we need to make a decision tree (easy).
Also, we need to somehow get training data for the things.
(Maybe we could also make it a Google Assistant for fun...?)

We need to determine what the training data should be.



RUNS:
3) Redness (w/ kernel) Maybe? :: Use derivatives!
4) Make a simple NN to diagnose
1) Create UI (simple image upload and image + mask output)
2) Work with K-Means
